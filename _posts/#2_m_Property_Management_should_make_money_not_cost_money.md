## Property Management should make money not cost money ##
 



- It is always our aim to manage each investors property as if it were our own. Like you we too want to keep any costs to a minimum.


- We will always effectively communicate with each of our investor owners when repairs need to be undertaken within their lot.


- This equally applies when we act to rectify repairs that are located within the common property that surrounds their lot.


- We will be in contact with the Executive Committee to rectify any damage or fault in a timely manner.


- As all of our investor owners would be aware the Owners Corporation is responsible under s62 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996 to maintain and repair any part of the common property that has for some reason become damaged.


- Other important considerations are the legal aspects of property management.


- In the litigious society that we live in, a property owner can ill afford to handle a problem tenant in an incorrect manner.


- As professional Property Managers we are well versed in landlord tenant law, and are abreast of the constantly changing legislation governing them.

We look forward to speaking to you and working with you personally to achieve the best results in the management of your property!
