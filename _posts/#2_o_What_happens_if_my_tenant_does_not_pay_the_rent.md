## What happens if my tenant does not pay the rent? ##


- We monitor tenant arrears on a daily basis. When a tenant is 3+ days in arrears we will contact them via telephone, email and SMS. On the 5th & 10th day we will also post an Arrears Breach Notice. If we still have not received rent after 14 days we will issue a Termination Notice on the 15th day giving them 14 clear days to vacate.

 

- Along with the Termination Notice we will issue a Notice to inspect the property and complete a final condition report and an assessment will be made to determine if any damage has been done to the property. Following the completion of this report, the assessment will determine the amount of Bond that is to be refunded to the out going tenant. 

 

- We will communicate with you throughout this process and a Termination Notice will never be issued without discussing the situation with you first. It is our intention at all times to minimise any loss to the owner so these actions need to be carried out promptly.



- Should you wish to make further enquiries of these services please Please contact Northside Property Management at the contact us page and forward our office an email.  We look forward to speaking to you and working with you personally to achieve the best results in the management of your property!
