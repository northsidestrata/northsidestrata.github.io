##  Manage Your Investment ##

At **Northside Property Management** our team manages your property as if it was our own. We look for the best tenants and regularly check and inspect your property to ensure that it remains in its best condition throughout the length of the tenancy in order to protect your long term invetment goals.

At **Northside Property Management** we also have the further advantage of being experienced Strata Managers within the buildings that we manage and know the buildings intimately.
Our Investor clients report that they are very satisfied with the ability to contact a Property Manager who knows the building and the difference between common and private property and has direct contact with the Executive Committee.
As a property investor you want to be assured that your property is managed properly.

Our Property Management Team headed by Lee Whitney who being a Licensed Real Estate Agent is a highly experienced, mature and client-focused professional.

Looking after the best interests of our investor clients is how we differentiate ourselves in the market.

At **Northside Property Management** we currently manage a mix of residential and commercial properties and are very familiar with the Lower North Shore and Northern Beaches areas where most of our current Strata and Property Management portfolio is located.

As Licensed Strata Managers and Real Estate Agents we offer realistic and discounted fee structures to owners and investors in the strata buildings we already manage, that in turn give you peace of mind and a high level of service.

Responsiveness is important in our business - each member of our team is accountable for the effective and timely management of your property as well as its successful leasing.

By adopting our proactive and systematic approach to property management, you receive the highest standards of property management every time.
