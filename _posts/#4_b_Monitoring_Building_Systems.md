## Monitoring Building Systems ##

 
Essential Safety Measures Compliance is achieved by our Complaince Inspection Monitoring and Reporting System.



- Inspection Records and Reports are sent to our Fire Systems Inspector by email


- The Fire Systems Inspector can print the Inspection Record or just view it on the computer screen.


- The required tasks are carried out and an electronic Inspection Report is kept to allow for the updating of the building database


- A Compliance Status Report is sent to the client to identify tasks, repairs and maintenance which are either Current, Completed, needing Follow-up or are Overdue


- Our Fire Systems Inspector will advise the course of action to follow, which may include the option to call for quotes to undertake the neccessary repairs or upgrades of the safety measures installed omsite.


- At the conclusion of each 12 month period, the Compliance Status Report is reviewed to confirm if all inspections and tests have been carried out according to the requirements of the Certificate of Occupancy and whether the Annual Maintenance Statement or Report supplied with each customised manual can be signed by the Owner or Agent. It is also recommended that a Final Inspection be carried out of the Essential Safety Measures onsite before signing the Annual Maintenance Statement/Report to confirm that no substantial remedial works are still outstanding.
