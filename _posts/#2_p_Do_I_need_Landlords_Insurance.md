## Do I need Landlords Insurance? ##




- As with any insurance policy, it is not compulsory to have landlord insurance on your property however we strongly recommend that every property investor has a specific landlord insurance policy in place for their property. Landlord Insurance protects you in the event of a tenant not paying rent, departing the property early or damaging the property. It also includes public liability and limited cover for contents (e.g. floor coverings, curtains).
