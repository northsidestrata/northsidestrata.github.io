Northside Strata Management - Strata Specialists

Whitney Property Group's strata division is called **Northside Strata Management** which is a smaller professional strata practice specialising in the management of Strata and Community schemes in Sydney. We currently manage and provide a highly personalised service to all of our clients. Lee Whitney is the Principal and Licensee. Our personal service includes obvious phone support which we have found is important to our clients as well as personal email contact with our office and the provision of detailed monthly reports to each Strata Scheme.
If you are not satisfied with the level of service you are currently receiving from your Strata Management provider, why don't you contact us and enquire how Northside Strata Management can help you manage your Strata Scheme more effectively.  

Our offices are fully computerised using the latest industry software which is regularly updated providing an extensive database, detailed accounting and produces a range of user friendly reports.   

Levies may be paid by Electronic Funds Transfer on the internet, through the DEFT payment system to Macquarie Bank. Levies can be paid by BPAY, credit card or at any branch of Australia Post for your convenience.  

As Corporate members of the Institute of Strata Title Management we use their standard form of Agency Agreement, which clearly identifies the services that are included in the regular management. There are no additional fees charged by us for our time in providing these regular services (other than the direct costs of printing, photocopying, postage, telephone etc). The services that we offer are detailed in Schedule A of the Agency Agreement and are the basis of the Strata Management agreed services fee.  

I bring to the table an attitude “to get the job done”. I am always "solution oriented". I do not just sit back and coast. It is my job to manage the day to day issues of the building, protect all of the common property, and address and resolve all issues in the best interests of The Owners Corporation and in consultation with The Executive Committee.
