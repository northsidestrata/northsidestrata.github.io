## Inspections  ##

 

There are four categories of Essential Safety Measures which require routine inspections

1. Fire equipment
2. Electrical fittings
3. Air Conditioning/Mechanical Ventilation systems
4. Exit Doors, Paths of Egress and Passive Fire Elements

Specialist maintenance providers are normally contracted to carry out the first three, whilst **Northside Strata and Property Management** as the Strata Manager of the Scheme will engage a Fire Inspector to carry out the Quarterly Paths Of Travel/Exit Door Inspections and the Annual Passive Fire Element inspections.

The revised AS1851-2005 standard now also requires that Surveys be carried out annually of each of the safety measures or systems by a competent person to determine whether any changes have taken place over the past 12 months that may have compromised the operation of the installed essential safety measures or that may require additional safety measures to be installed in the building.

Please [contact us](http://sample.com.au "contact_us") or call **Northside Strata Managment **on (02) 8407 9314 in order to confirm whether these surveys need to be carried out in your building.
