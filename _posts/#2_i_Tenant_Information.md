## Tenant Information ##

**Welcome:**

Northside Property Management welcomes all of our new tenants. We hope you enjoy your stay in the property that you have leased through one of the owners in the building that we manage as the Strata Manager.



- There are a number of responsibilities and rules to living in a Strata Unit;


- like owners tenants also have to observe the by-laws of the building;


- press [here](http://sample.com.au "By-Laws") to view a copy of the standard by-laws under the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996.

- Whilst strata living can provide a friendly community style environment, it helps to remember that it is not the same as living in a freestanding house.


- Some activities may be more restricted in a strata scheme, for example, where you can park your car, hang your washing or when and how you can renovate.


- Understanding these differences before moving into a strata scheme can help reduce the likelihood of disputes over these activities later on.

It is your responsibility to have all the services at the property connected and placed in your name. 
Contact numbers the main utility companies are:

**Rental Payments:**



- Your rent must be paid in advance at all times.


- If at any time you are unable to make a rental payment in full and/or on time, please make immediate contact with your Property Manager here.


- Please note that if you are sharing the property with another person (whose name is on the Tenancy Agreement), you are both equally liable for paying the rent.


- All rental payments must be made by the method that has been provided to you. Unfortunately, we do not accept cash or personal cheques at the office.

**Property Condition Report:**



- Two copies of the Property Condition Report are provided to you. This report is very important as it outlines the condition of the property at the commencement of your tenancy.


- When you have vacated the property the condition at that time is compared to the condition at commencement and any variation (fair wear and tear excepted) will be your responsibility to reinstate.


- Please review the Property Condition Report thoroughly making any additional comments you feel are necessary to accurately establish the condition of the property. It is in your best interests to ensure that it is a comprehensive and accurate description of the property’s current condition.


- When you have completed the Report, please sign and return it within the first 7 days of your tenancy, retaining the blue copy for your records.


- If a signed copy is not returned to this agency and a dispute arises at the end of your tenancy, the condition of the property will most likely be assessed as that indicated on the Report completed by this office.

**Rental Bond:**



- Your Rental Bond will be lodged with the NSW Office of Fair Trading and is held as security against any unpaid rent or damage to the property. Upon lodgment you will receive written confirmation from the Department of Fair Trading providing you with a Rental Bond Registration Number.


- Your Rental Bond will be refunded to you soon after you vacate the property, provided all rent has been paid and no monies owing for cleaning or repairs.

**Repairs and Maintenance:**



- All requests for repairs and maintenance are best reported via our website. To do this, please select the press here. 


- In the event of an urgent repair required outside office hours, and your Property Manager is un-contactable, arrangement for repairs can be made directly with the trades people listed on the front page of your Residential Tenancy Agreement.


- Your Property Manager will attend to all non urgent repairs within 2 working days; however in many instances it will be necessary to obtain the owner’s approval before any work can commence.

**Routine Inspections:**



- During the course of your tenancy, your Property Manager will inspect your property periodically, after you have been given 7 days notice. This will include an inspection 3 months after your tenancy commences and then every 3 months to a maximum of 4 times per calendar year.


- We will contact you in advance to arrange a mutually convenient time. The purpose of these inspections is to advise the owner of the condition of the property, how it is being maintained by you, and to allow you to advise us of any repairs or maintenance you feel are needed.

**Keys:**



- Our office retains a duplicate key to all properties for emergency access only.


- Unfortunately, locks can only be changed, added to or altered after you have obtained permission from your Property Manager, and you would then need to supply us with any new keys.

**Insurance:**



- Unfortunately, the owner’s insurance cover on the property does not extend to cover your belongings. On this basis, we strongly suggest that you take out comprehensive contents insurance to cover your belongings against fire, theft and other perils.


- In the event that you, another occupier, or visitor accidentally damages the property and rectification work is required, you may be required to pay any excess that may apply to the owner’s insurance cover.

**Sub-Leasing:**



- Your Tenancy Agreement states the maximum permissible number of people who can occupy the property. If there is any change, in either the original occupants or any additional occupants move into the property, please notify your Property Manager immediately.


- The owner’s consent is required should you wish to sub-lease the property.

**Visitors and Guests:**



- All tenants named on the Tenancy Agreement are equally responsible for the behaviour of their guests (including any children) while on the property.
