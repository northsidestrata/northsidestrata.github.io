## Commercial Strata ##



- Northside Strata Management manages many Commercial Strata buildings originally just on the Lower North Shore of Sydney. Due to our business growth and success in this field, our company now manages many different types of Commercial buildings. In these types of buildings we also attend to the Facilities Management of the building, ensuring that all of the supporting services, contracts and agreements are up to date and all contractors are properly qualified to complete the work they are required to undertake.


- All of the accounts are managed in a professional manner with the assistance of a thorough online reporting package that keeps the Executive Committee informed at all times.
Should you be looking for a competant Strata Manager who is experienced in Building Facilities Management to assist your Executive Committee in the efficient running of the building and to meet their statutory  and compliance obligations then you have come to the right place !


- Please [contact us](http://sample.com.au "contact us page") at our office to arrange an obligation free meeting onsite with your Executive Committee to discuss your needs and goals so that we may aim to exceed your service expectations. 
              I look forward to meeting with you personally.
