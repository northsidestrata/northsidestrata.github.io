## Essential Fire Safety Measuresâ€¦ Made Easy ##

Essential Fire Safety Measures are the fire safety systems required in residential Unit buildings, commercial, industrial & public buildings to ensure the safety of the buildings occupants by giving a suitable warning tn the event of a fire or emergency. The Environmental Planning & Assessment Regulations 2000 mandates that all Essential Fire Safety Measures must be maintained and that on the anniversary of the date of the Final Fire Safety Certificate, an Annual Fire Safety Statement must to be prepared by the owner or agent and displayed on the premises.

In many cases, the relevant Council may send a reminder to the owner that the Annual Fire Safety Statement (AFSS) is due and attach a list of those Fire Safety Measures that must be certified.  Many Councils are ***now not issuing reminders*** to owners and so the obligation to "cause an AFSS to be lodged" on time is now very important as fines will normally apply for late or non compliance.

Some Councils also charge a fee with each submission of the AFSS. It is up to the building owner to ensure that an AFSS is prepared and submitted each year to the Council and that a further copy is sent to the Fire Commissioner on time so as to avoid a fine.


Whitney Property Group recommends you log onto the website of your local Council which often will have information releting to the EPA Regulations, copies of the AFSS forms that should be completed and who to talk to about these regulatory issues. Most Councils have a Fire Safety Officer or Co-ordinator who can assist with these enquiries. Whitney Property Group is well placed to assist all Owners Corporations prepare both their building and the necessary documantation ready for submission to the statutory authorities in a timely manner.
