## Strata Bookkeeping ##

Nearly half of all strata schemes in NSW comprise of only two lots. We understand that schemes of 2 or 3 lots often have different requirements to larger schemes where the nature of the development generates little common area management. 

Whitney Property Group who specialises in providing a personal service to its clients can provide a book keeping and basic compliance service. We aim to ensure that you comply with your legal and financial obligations under the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996 however your Executive Committee attends to all maintenance and harmony issues that may occur. This offers substantial savings for schemes that do not require any other support. 

We will attend to the following: 


- Issue levy notices


- Pay invoices approved by and forwarded from the executive committee (treasurer).


- Provide full and compliant financial reporting


- Issue the notices for AGM upon instruction from the executive committee


- Arrange for payment of annual insurance premiums.

In considering this service it is important to note that that it would exclude items such as: 


- attending to repairs and maintenance,


- attendance at any meetings (we send out all notices, but do not attend your Annual General Meeting),


- any harmony or correspondence issues such as dealing with disruptive occupants or disputes between owners


- dealing with outside parties such as councils or neighbours.


- Telephone or email enquiries from owners or purchasers.


- The cost of providing these additional services would be based on our standard hourly rate if subsequently needed. 

This service is best suited to small blocks where owners intend to run the building themselves and have an active Executive Committee.
