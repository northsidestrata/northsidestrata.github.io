## How To Become a Client ##

Changing to **Northside Property Management** is easy!

Did you know you can change managing agents without affecting the tenancy in any way, even if your property is tenanted and on a current lease?

At **Northside Property Management** we also have the further advantage of being experienced Strata Managers within the buildings that we manage and know the buildings intimately.

Our Investor clients report that they are very satisfied with the ability to contact a Property Manager who knows the building and the difference between common and private property and has direct contact with the Executive Committee.


**Currently managed by another agency?**

All you have to do is make the decision and we will provide a seamless transition, taking care of everything.

You will not have to call or correspond with your current agency.

We will send your current agent the [Transfer Letter](http://sample.com.au "documents_Property_Management_transfer_letter") that you have signed and make arrangements to collect your property file, keys and necessary documentation.
