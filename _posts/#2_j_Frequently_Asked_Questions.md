## Frequently Asked Questions: ##
What happens at the end of the fixed term of the lease?

The fixed-term agreement is a defined period of the tenancy which is written into your lease. This is usually 6 or 12 months but the parties can agree to have a tenancy agreement for any length of time. When the fixed-term period ends the tenancy agreement does not end unless it is terminated by the tenant or the landlord.

How much notice must be given when I plan to vacate the property?



- In the last 14 days of the fixed-term period of the agreement, either party can give 14 days notice to end the tenancy. This notice can be served up to and including the last day of the fixed term.


- Once the fixed-term period has ended you are required to give at least 21 days notice.


- The landlord or agent must give you at least 60 days notice.


- If there is a breach of the tenancy agreement, a notice period of 14 days applies.
If the landlord wants to sell the premises, you may be asked to vacate the premises by the time the sale is finalised.


- The landlord must give you at least 30 days written notice (after the contracts of sale have been entered into). This only applies after the fixed term has ended.
