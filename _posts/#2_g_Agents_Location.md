## Agents Location ##
Is an agents location important to their ability to manage my property?



- One of the most common misconceptions about finding an agent to manage your property is that they need to be located in your local area or neighbourhood.


- Long gone are the days when prospective tenants went from real estate agency window to real estate agency window looking for properties to rent in any particular area. They simply don't have the time.


- Almost 100% of our entire tenant enquiry now comes from the internet. This means that we can quickly and easily lease properties in a very large geographic area. We can also very quickly assess rents in any given area to determine what the right amount of rent is for a particular property.


- At **Northside Property Management** we easily manage all of our properties in suburbs located in the North Shore and the Northern Beaches all from 1 office location. 


- At **Whitney Property Group** we also have the further advantage of being experienced Strata Managers within the buildings that we manage and know the buildings intimately.


- Our Investor clients report that they are very satisfied with the ability to contact a Property Manager who knows the building and the difference between common and private property and has direct contact with the Executive Committee.
