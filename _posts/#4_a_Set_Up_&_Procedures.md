## Set Up & Procedures  ##

 

Whitney Property Group's Building  Facilities Managament service carries out an on site survey of the building that will identify the essential safety measures present and their locations. Contractors and inspectors are then assigned to carry out the maintenance and testing of each essential safety measures item identified.

The collected data is entered into a software database by our Fire Systems Inspector and Essential Safety Measures Manuals are prepared for each site. Each customised manual includes the following information:




- Owner Details


- Building Details


- Essential Safety Measures Equipment List


- Maintenance Contractor Details


- Inspection Standards and Frequencies


- A 12 Month Inspection Schedule


- Inspection Records for 12 months


- A pre-prepared Annual Maintenance Statement or Report

A contractor briefing session is normally established to advise the specialist contractors what is required from them in order that correct record keeping practices are adopted.

Whitney Property Group will request that the Fire Systems Inspector will  provide an Observations Report which highlights any Essential Safety Measures in need of urgent repair or issues requiring further investigation by a competent professional.

The Set Up phase is a mandatory pre-requisite for any of other services.
