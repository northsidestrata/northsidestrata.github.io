*Northside Property Management - Property Specialists*


Unit rental and tenant management - First class service at a discounted rate.

**Northside Property Managemeent** was specifically created to manage the rental properties of Investor Owners in Strata Schemes that we currently manage.  As skillful, experienced Strata Managers and Licensed Real Estate Agents we are therefore able to pass on considerable cost savings to Investor Owners with discounted Management Fees available to them when we are appointed to manage their rental property.

As resident Strata Managers there are a number of reasons to choose Northside Property Management to manage your investment property;



- we already have an intimate physical knowledge of the buildings that we manage and the differences between common property and personal property within each lot;   


- we are already aware of the By-Laws and have direct access to each of Strata Plans of every building that we manage; 


- we have already checked the qualifications and insurances of each of the contractors that are engaged by our Strata Division to carry our any repairs to any common property of the building;


- we know the workmanship and professionalism of our preferred contractors and are very comfortable in recommending their services to you or to attending to any repairs and maintenance issues within your investment unit.


- have an excellent working relationship with all of the Executive Committees in each of the buildings;


- and are well aware of the ongoing financial priorities and goals of the Owners Corporation.
 
Whilst we are in the property business, our team know it's a people business, and trust is the currency. Our Agency and our success have been built on this trust.

Our offices are fully computerised using the latest industry software which is regularly updated providing an extensive database, detailed accounting and produces a range of user friendly reports.   

Rent may be paid by Electronic Funds Transfer on the internet, through the DEFT payment system to Macquarie Bank. Rent can be paid by BPAY, credit card or at any branch of Australia Post for your convenience.

As members of the Real Estate Institute of Australia we use their standard form of Agency Agreement, which clearly identifies the services that are included in the regular management.  

I bring to the table an attitude “to get the job done”. I do not just sit back and coast. It is my job to manage the day to day issues of each of the Investors Units, see that repairs and maintenance are completed in a timely manner, look to always provide the best financial return for each Owner and manage any issues that may arise between the tenant and the Owners Corporation.
