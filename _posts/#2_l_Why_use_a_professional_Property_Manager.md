## Why use a professional Property Manager? ##


- A number of owners choose to manage their property themselves and many of them are very successful.


- However, with the time involved in collecting rents, arranging repairs, locating the best tenants as well as resolving any dispute resolution process that may arise from time to time, most owners have found that as their time is valuable it is far more economical to have a professional address these issues.


- This approach leavs the investor more time to manage the growth of their property portolio, than get side-tracked by the administrative time required for effective hands on management.


- At **Northside Property Management** we also have the further advantage of being experienced Strata Managers within the buildings that we manage and know the buildings intimately.


- Our Investor clients report that they are very satisfied with the ability to contact a Property Manager who knows the building and the difference between common and private property and has direct contact with the Executive Committee.
