## Annual Fire Safety Statements & Reports   ## 
In NSW each building that is required to submit a 15(a) certificate otherwise known as an Annual Fire Safety Statement must be submitted on or before the due date to Council and the Board of Fire Commissioners.

This annual statement is required to be signed by the Building Owner or the Ownerâ€™s Agent after each 12 month period.

As Strata Manager of  the buildings we manage we will check that the on-site records are complete and to determine if all Essential Safety Measures are operating and have been maintained during the past 12 months. These due-diligence checks are recommended before the Annual Maintenance Statements/Reports can be signed by or on behalf of the Owner.
